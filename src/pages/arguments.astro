        "Students learn to fact-check and verify sources of information",
        "Development of critical thinking through online discourse",

      impact: "By removing access to these platforms, we risk creating a generation less prepared for the digital workplace and modern communication landscape, exacerbated even further by COVID."

    title: "Overly broad definition",

    ],
    expanded: {
      details: "The current state of the proposal suggests that sites like YouTube, Scratch, and other genuinely useful platforms will be subject to age restrictions. This is a massive problem even with an explicit bypass list, as now there are technically 2 lists to maintain and keep up with.",
      examples: [
        "YouTube videos, often a good tutorial for hard-to-understand concepts, get blocked from people who need it the most",
        "No clear, unified and safe alternative exists for some of these sites",
        "Scratch, a deliberately children-first site, could be banned with no clear alternative",
        "Free and open-source maintainers struggle to keep up with the new rules and don't have as many resources to catch up"

      "Unnecessarily intensive monitoring using resources that could be better spent elsewhere"

      details: "The enforcement of social media bans presents significant practical challenges. While VPNs can be used to circumvent bans, age verification systems can be difficult to implement consistently across platforms, leading to inconsistent enforcement.",
      examples: [
        "VPNs can be used to circumvent bans, effectively nullifying bans",
        "Age verification systems can be difficult to implement consistently across platforms",
        "Certain platforms may have more resources to enforce bans than others",

  {
    title: "Privacy and rights",
    description: "Bans can infringe on personal rights and the verification system the government wants will create privacy concerns.",
    points: [
      "Restriction of free expression without freedom from fear",
      "Limited access to information that can be crucial",
      "Privacy risks from ID-based verification systems",
      "Not many other alternatives that are as safe and secure as should be necessary"
    ],
    expanded: {
      details: "Social media bans can infringe on personal rights and create privacy concerns. Requiring ID to be sent over the internet is simply just a disaster waiting to happen.",

        "Age verification systems can restrict access to information",
        "Privacy & security risks are spawned when using an ID-based verification systems",
        "This can increase the risk of both identity theft and civil danger to the user",
        "Restriction of free expression, even more so with government surveillance technically on the cards"
